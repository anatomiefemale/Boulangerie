Hello!

This repository, **Boulangerie** contains scripts for Machine Learning algorithms, baked from scratch. Also includes scripts for artificial intelligence. 
**Under Construction**

**1. Frosting.py** Python script, implementing Logistic Regression from scratch.

**2. Cookies.ipynb** Python script, implementing a customized CNN for normal vs. breast cancer histology classification. **Chocolate_Chip_Cookies.py** provides this model as a .py Data available at OSF Boulangerie.

**3. Pink_Sugar.py** Python script, implementing a customized medical chatBot, pre-trained on GPT-2.

**4. Chocolate_Croissant.py** Python script, implementing a transformer model built from scratch, applied for binary classification of an arbitrary encoded patient dataset.

**5. Vanilla_Scone.py** Python script, implementing LSTM from scratch, for text generation.

**6. Cinnamon_Roll.py** Python script, implementing an example of molecular generation after training BERT on SMILES data.

**7. Rasberry_Tart.py** Python script, implementing keyword search using TF-IDF to extract keywords associated with Hypertension or Diabetes.
